I used React App and some Bootstrap to create this project. I felt like the framework for React App most closely paired to the entire paradigm of Grid design by constantly creating reusable components that can quickly be updated without having to change other parts of the code. I used a mix of bootstrap and raw css to create the elements as the bootstrap would save time and money to get the same effect while the raw css allowed me to more closely mirror the exact placement required for mirroring the design.

I think the most difficult aspect was creating the responsive design with the elements. The containers were quite easy but with the inner elements they'd be prone to unpredictable behavior unless given a set measurement so I decided to mix both and keep the containers mostly with view port percentages but the elements I kept set size and used media queries to resize them at specific breakpoints for mobile devices.

I really enjoyed the challenge of this project as it allowed me to sharpen specifically mobile responsiveness and the grid design system which I feel are much more useful to both web and mobile development as they're far more reusable than the FlexBox. It truly hit home when I created the media queries because having the containers already in grid with percentage sizes I saved time having to resize every part of the website and was able to just focus on inner elements.
